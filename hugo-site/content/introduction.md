## An Outstanding Opportunity to Do Good

Many of us aspire to make a meaningful impact in the world. Witnessing suffering, injustice, and death prompts us to want to take action. Yet, finding a tangible solution to these issues, and more importantly, implementing it, is not straightforward.

Effective altruism offers a solution to this challenge. It is a research field dedicated to maximizing the impact of our efforts to aid others. By employing rigorous evidence and thoughtful reasoning, effective altruism seeks to address the question of how we can help others most effectively.

## Many Attempts to Do Good Fail

Throughout history, some individuals have had an extraordinary positive impact. Norman Borlaug's work on drought-resistant wheat saved hundreds of millions from starvation. Stanislav Petrov's cool-headed decision during a nuclear false alarm may have prevented World War III.

But many well-intentioned efforts fail or even cause harm. The key is to identify what works and what doesn't.

## The Framework: Importance, Tractability, Neglectedness

When deciding which problems to focus on, effective altruists consider three factors:

- **Importance:** How many people are affected, and how deeply?
- **Tractability:** Can we actually make progress on this problem?
- **Neglectedness:** How many resources are already being devoted to it?

## Key Focus Areas

### Fighting Extreme Poverty

Global poverty remains one of the most pressing issues. Organizations like GiveWell have identified interventions that can save a life for a few thousand dollars, such as distributing malaria bed nets or providing deworming treatments.

### Animal Suffering

Factory farming affects billions of animals each year. This is an area where relatively small investments can have outsized impact due to the sheer scale and neglectedness of the issue.

### Safeguarding the Long-term Future

Existential risks from advanced AI, engineered pandemics, and other emerging technologies pose threats to humanity's entire future. Working to reduce these risks could protect the wellbeing of all future generations.
