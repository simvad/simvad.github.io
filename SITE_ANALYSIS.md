## Key Observations for Modernization
1. Site feels dated (WordPress/Elementor style, heavy, jQuery-dependent)
2. Events section is essentially empty (last events from 2018)
3. Blog has only 2 posts
4. Mobile-first responsive design already present
5. Good content structure but could benefit from cleaner typography and layout
6. Newsletter form appears in multiple places (good pattern to keep)
7. "Book a Chat With Us" persistent CTA is a good UX pattern to preserve
